# IPv4/IPv6 First-Class Support Implementation Plan

## Executive Summary

This document outlines the implementation plan for making IPv4 and IPv6 first-class citizens in the scan application. The goal is to allow users to specify protocol preferences (IPv4, IPv6, or Both) and have all scanners respect these preferences while providing protocol-specific results.

**Key Objectives:**
- Enable protocol selection via user interface (TUI key press)
- Provide detailed protocol-specific results for each scanner
- Support concurrent IPv4/IPv6 scanning when requested
- Maintain backward compatibility during migration
- Improve debugging capabilities for dual-stack environments

## Current State Analysis

### Existing Architecture
The scan application currently uses a generic approach where:
- Targets are resolved to IP addresses without protocol preference
- Scanners operate on "primary IP" or "network target" without protocol awareness
- Results are protocol-agnostic (single result per scanner)
- No user control over protocol selection

### Current Scanner Behavior
| Scanner | IPv4/IPv6 Handling | Current Limitations |
|---------|-------------------|-------------------|
| DNS | Separate A/AAAA queries | No protocol filtering |
| Ping | Uses first resolved IP | Cannot compare IPv4 vs IPv6 latency |
| Port | Scans single IP | Missing dual-stack port analysis |
| HTTP/TLS | Connects to first IP | Cannot test both protocol endpoints |
| Traceroute | Uses first resolved IP | Cannot trace both protocols |
| GeoIP | Uses first resolved IP | Missing geographic comparison |
| Whois | Domain-based | Minimal impact |

## Proposed Solution

### Protocol Enum
```rust
#[derive(Debug, Clone, Copy, PartialEq, Eq)]
pub enum Protocol {
    Ipv4,    // IPv4 only
    Ipv6,    // IPv6 only 
    Both,    // Both IPv4 and IPv6 (default)
}
```

### Enhanced Target Methods
Add protocol-aware methods to the Target struct:
- `ips_for_protocol(protocol: Protocol) -> Vec<IpAddr>`
- `primary_ip_for_protocol(protocol: Protocol) -> Option<IpAddr>`
- `network_target_for_protocol(protocol: Protocol) -> Option<String>`
- `supports_protocol(protocol: Protocol) -> bool`

### Scanner Trait Changes
```rust
#[async_trait]
pub trait Scanner {
    async fn scan(&self, target: &Target, protocol: Protocol) -> Result<ScanResult>;
    // ... other methods unchanged
}
```

### Protocol-Aware Result Types

#### Example: PingResult Transformation
**Before:**
```rust
pub struct PingResult {
    pub latency: Duration,
    pub packet_loss: f32,
    pub ttl: Option<u8>,
    pub packets_sent: u32,
    pub packets_received: u32,
}
```

**After:**
```rust
pub struct PingResult {
    pub ipv4: Option<PingData>,
    pub ipv6: Option<PingData>,
    pub requested_protocol: Protocol,
    pub scan_duration: Duration,
}

pub struct PingData {
    pub target_ip: IpAddr,
    pub latency: Duration,
    pub packet_loss: f32,
    pub ttl: Option<u8>,
    pub packets_sent: u32,
    pub packets_received: u32,
    pub protocol_version: IpVersion,
}
```

## Technical Design

### Error Handling Strategy
When protocol doesn't match target capabilities:
1. **Fail explicitly** - Return clear error message
2. **Report in TUI** - Show "IPv4 not available for this target"
3. **Log appropriately** - Debug information for troubleshooting

### Concurrent Scanning
For `Protocol::Both`:
- Scanners perform IPv4 and IPv6 operations concurrently using `tokio::join!`
- Results are collected into protocol-specific fields
- Timeouts apply per protocol, not globally

### Backward Compatibility
**Phase 1: Additive Changes**
- Add new protocol-aware fields alongside existing fields
- Populate both old and new fields during transition
- TUI displays old fields initially

**Phase 2: Migration**  
- Update TUI to use new protocol-aware fields
- Add user controls for protocol selection
- Test thoroughly with dual-stack environments

**Phase 3: Cleanup**
- Remove deprecated fields
- Simplify code paths
- Update documentation
